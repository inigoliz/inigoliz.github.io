      <h2 class="card">Who am I?</h3>
      <p class="card">I am Iñigo (pronouced /e-gne-go/). I am a maker and an entrepreneur.
        I am 25 years old and Spanish but I have an international soul.
        I am seduced by the simplicity of good ideas and crazy about creating
        things with my own hands: from visual algorithms that vibrate with the
        beat of the music, to a vision system that broadcasts what my former cat would
        see through her day or even a handcrafted brewing station.</p>

      <p class="card">I studied quantum physics but moved to the creative side
        to combine technology, music and visuals. In my free time I also find
        myself stuck trying to launch startup ideas, the latest one an optical
        chip that would replace electronics and that works by combining color frequencies.</p>

      <p class="card">I have experience living in an international community where
        all the neighbors in the building would get involved in shared events:
        opera nights, jam sessions in the rooftop or masterchef cooking contests
        were some of them. And it was simply the best time of my life. That is
        why I resonated so much with your leit motif “You are the sum of those who surround you”.</p>

      <p class="card">I am the type of person who gets involved in the community life and drives events
        – I get sentimental when talking about how a friend ad me created up a Sunday night jam session
        in our flat. At some point we grew up so much that we would gather 12 musicians and even have an
        alto saxo! I was playing the guitar and driving the session with a synth in my iPad.</p>

      <h2 class="card">Further details</h3>
        <p class="card">I am planning to stay long term in the city (and therefore, in the house) because
          I have a full time job as a software developer in a company called Capture One. Besides that,
          I am willing to move asap and the rent and the rooms description seems perfect vfor me.
          I am clean and organized. But most importantly, I am great at fixing broken dishwashers.</p>

      <h2 class="card">Please, reach out</h3>
        <p class="card">Please, rreach out if you find me interesting and you would like to live with me.
          I would love to enter your community and bring my best energy to make it even better!
          Lets go for a coffee all together. And I hope I can convince you I am the perfect fit for NestCPH.</p>
